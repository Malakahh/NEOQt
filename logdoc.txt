Documentation of the log file

Model: GBC07
WORD size: 2 bytes

Terms:
	- Log file: The log file is the entire size of the EEprom - program_start - program_size, used to contain all logs.
	- Log: Each individual log is contained within the log file, and consists of the length of the log as well as each data point.
	- Data point: A vector containing TIME, STEP, VOLTAGE, CURRENT, and TEMP.

The log file begins with two WORDs, followed by each individual log. The first WORD is always 0x1234, this indicates the beginning of the log file.
The second WORD is an offset from the address of the first WORD (0x1234), which points to the address of the size of the oldest log.

A log begins with a WORD describing the size of the log in WORDs. Following this, the log is split into data points.
Each data point consists of three WORDs.

WORD 0: 9 lowest bits contains VOLTAGE in x100mV. The highest 7 bits contains TEMP.
example:
	WORD: 			3921
	VOLTAGE		=	3921 & 0x01FF						gives 0x121 == 289 (* 100mV)
	TEMP		=	3921 >> 9							gives 0x1C == 28

WORD 1: The lowest byte contains CURRENT in x100mA. The highest byte contains STEP.
example:
	WORD: 			7120
	CURRENT		=	7120 & 0xFF 						gives 0x20 == 32 (* 100mA)
	STEP		=	(0120 >> 8) && 0x3F 				gives 0x01 == 1
	TIME (MSB)	= 	7120 >> 14							gives 0x0x == 1

WORD 2: Contains TIME
example:
	WORD: 			008E
	TIME		=	008E
